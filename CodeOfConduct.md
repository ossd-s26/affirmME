## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in affirmME and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to creating a respectful, collaborative, and inclusive environment for all participants.

## Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language  
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences  
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism  
- Focusing on what is best for the community and project  
- Showing empathy toward other community members  

### Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances  
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
- Public or private harassment  
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission  
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting  

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, documentation, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. Maintainers may also temporarily or permanently ban contributors for behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including:

- GitHub repositories  
- Issues and pull requests  
- Project documentation  
- Discussions and communication channels  

It also applies when an individual is representing affirmME or its community in public spaces. Examples include:

- Using an official project email address  
- Posting via an official project account  
- Acting as a representative at an online or offline event  

This Code of Conduct may also apply outside project spaces if an individual's behavior has a direct and negative impact on the project or its community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers through [email](rab9635@nyu.edu) or by direct message to a maintainer.

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The maintainers are committed to maintaining confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers who fail to follow or enforce this Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by the project leadership.
